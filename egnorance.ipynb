(Note that the size of the compressed image varies somewhat from one implementation of the PNG compressor to another.) The value of `K(image|context)` indicates the size of `image` when compressed in an alternative scheme. To put the alternative scheme concretely, if Alice and Bob have agreed upon a universal computer and the `context`, then Alice can transmit to Bob a program that outputs `image` on input of `context`, and Bob can run the program with input of `context` to recover `image`. So the ASC of an image is the difference in size when it is compressed by two different approaches, one of which does not exploit the context, and the other of which does.\n",

The absurdity is even more pronounced in the case of *Apotheosis*, in which a very short program operates only on the context image *Rushmore*. The \"meaningful information\" of the output of the program is about twice as great as that of *Rushmore*. That is, according to Ewert, Dembski, and Marks, there is not loss of information, but instead a gain of over 100 million bits of meaningful information when *Rushmore* is scrambled irreversibly to produce the patently meaningless *Apotheosis of Meaning*.\n",

    "Intelligent-design proponents Winston Ewert, William Dembski, and Robert Marks regard *algorithmic specified complexity* (ASC) as a measure of meaningful information. We shall follow their article \"<a href=\"http://robertmarks.org/REPRINTS/2015%20Measuring%20meaningful%20information%20in%20images.pdf\">Measuring Meaningful Information in Images: Algorithmic Specified Complexity</a>\" (2015) in approximating the ASC of an image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ASC(image) = size(compressed(image)) - K(image|context) bits,\n",
    "\n",
    "where `size(compressed(image))` is the number of bits in the image when it is losslessly compressed for storage in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, and `K(image|context)` is, loosely, the length of the shortest binary program that outputs `image` on input of the binary string `context`. (Note that the size of the compressed image varies somewhat from one implementation of the PNG compressor to another.) The value of `K(image|context)` indicates the size of `image` when compressed in an alternative scheme. To put the alternative scheme concretely, if Alice and Bob have agreed upon a ([Turing-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness), [prefix-free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_code), binary) programming language and the context, then Alice can transmit to Bob a short program that outputs a large image on input of the context, and Bob can run the program with input of the context to obtain the image. That is, the binary program serves as the compressed image. Thus the ASC of an image is the difference in size when it is compressed losslessly by two different approaches, one of which cannot exploit the context, and the other of which can. For rigorous mathematical analysis of ASC, see \"[Evo-Info 4: Non-conservation of algorithmic specified complexity](http://theskepticalzone.com/wp/evo-info-4-non-conservation-of-algorithmic-specified-complexity/).\"\n",
    "\n",

For each of the images above, the number of bits of code required to generate the image on input of the context&nbsp;&mdash; an upper bound on `K(image|context)`&nbsp;&mdash; is small in comparison to the number of bits in the PNG-compressed image. Thus\n",
